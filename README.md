# bluesky-mastodon-poster

Welcome to the (very WIP) Publish-to-Bluesky-and-Mastodon app!

With this app, you can publish text and/or image posts on both Bluesky and Mastodon social media platforms in one go.

To use the app, follow these simple steps:

1) Run the getMastodonToken.py script to get the necessary client key, secret, and access token for accessing the Mastodon API in the main script.
2) If you want to create an image post: copy a maximum of 4 images to the folder where your postStuff.py file resides.
3) Run the postStuff.py script. It will show you a menu where you can select whether you want to create a text-only post or an image post with or without text. Note that you can also add alt texts to your images.
4) Beware: the images in your app folder get deleted after they've been published.

That's it! This app is perfect for anyone who wants to publish on both Bluesky and Mastodon without the hassle of doing it separately. Download the .py file and start using it today!
